# SummaRuNNer（实现基本没问题）
Tensorflow implementation  of SummaRuNNer

the version of Tensorflow is 1.2.0

Usage:
   Now data & w2v model is provided, you can use them to train a model directly, then you should change the model directory to your trained model position for evaluation.

Result:
   in our data, it gets almost the same result with the Pytorch one. for ndcg@5, the difference between them is no more than 0.004(~0.5%).
